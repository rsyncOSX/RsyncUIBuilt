Concurrency and asynchronous execution are key components of Swift. The latest version of Swift makes it even more easy to write asynchronous code using SwiftÂ´s `async` and `await` keywords. The concurrency model of Swift is complex and it requiere, at least for me, time and study to understand the basics. Apart from GUI updates, which SwiftUI takes care of, there are no concurrency in RsyncUI. But there is asynchronous execution, but only one a time.  Every time a `rsync` synchronize and restore tasks are executed the termination of the task is not known ahead.  When the *termination signal* is observed some actions are required. Some actions are like send a message about a task is completed, execute next synchronize task, stopping a progressview and do some logging.  

```bash
// Combine, subscribe to Process.didTerminateNotification
        NotificationCenter.default.publisher(
            for: Process.didTerminateNotification)
            .debounce(for: .milliseconds(500), scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)
            .sink { [self] _ in
                self.processtermination(self.outputprocess?.getOutput(), self.config?.hiddenID)
                // Logg to file
                _ = Logfile(TrimTwo(outputprocess?.getOutput() ?? []).trimmeddata, error: false)
                // Release Combine subscribers
                subscriptons.removeAll()
            }.store(in: &subscriptons)
```
In theory there could be concurrency and asynchronous execution in RsyncUI. If a user of RsyncUI has two or more tasks added, RsyncUI could execute concurrent task. But it does not, it excutes one task at a time. When one task, which is executed asynchronous, is completed it kicks of next task. But every  `rsync` synchronize and restore task is asynchronous. When a task is executed, the GUI is updating a progressbar and waits until the task is completed. Combine is used to listen for termination of the exteranl process. When the termination signal is discovered, a completion handler is activated and causes RsyncUI to evaluate what next.
